    <h4>Personal Background</h4>
    <p>I grew up around the Chicago suburbs in Illinois and now <br> I currently attend Illinois State University. Constantly<br> finding a new exciting hobby to take on has been a <br>consistent trend throughout the majority of my life. From <br>oil painting to nail artistry to playing guitar, I love trying <br>new creative outlets whenever I get the chance. Graphic<br> design is my passion and it pushes me everyday.</p>

    <h4>Professional Skills</h4>
    <p>At Illinois State University I am currently in the BFA <br>program for Graphic Design. This program hones in my<br>skills in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and many <br>other important programs. I also have taken classes in<br> video editing, photography, typography, color theory,<br> web design, and plan on taking many more throughout<br> the rest of my college experience at ISU.</p>
